I am a Network Science PhD student at the Network Science Institute, Northeastern University, Boston. My current research focuses on understanding Human Behavior through the lens of Computational Social Science and Network Science.

In the past, I have delved into various applications of Network Science including modeling processes on networks, computational biology, financial systems and culinary science. Check out my publications for more details.
